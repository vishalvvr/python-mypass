# python-mypass
cli based password manager, stores encrypted passwords in a local tinydb

## Setup:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run:
```
Python3 main.py -h
```

## Migrate/Backup 
Make sure you take backup of `./mypass.json` & `~/mypass.ini` file

> Note: This is a simple hobby project with very limited security features but soon will add 
  - remote db access
  - mypass cli authentication

Happy Hacking :)
